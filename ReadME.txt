How to run your program:
Its compressed and was made using visual studio code in c++ and uses a simple
menu based program where it first asks you to choose if you want multiplayer and then input
players information. After it asks what game you want to play and go from there.

Progress of you assignment:
Sadly I didnt get to implement one more data structure from the 5. I implemented a stack, queue, linked list, and array list.
Also when i put the extra tiktack toe game when I play the roulette game when im done it automatically goes
to the tiktack toe game without me choosing it. But other than that the games work completley fine.

what data structure/ algorithms i used:
I used a queue for the players information
A stack for the scoring system
An array list for the money system
and a linked list for the tiktack toe game

Any other difficulties you encounter 
It was a bit difficult when choosing what data structure/algortithm to use. I ended up changing a 
lot of things because my attempt at the black jack ruined the game. But it was a very exciting
project esspecially getting to use all the data structures we learned througout the semseter.
It was defenetly a nice project to do.
