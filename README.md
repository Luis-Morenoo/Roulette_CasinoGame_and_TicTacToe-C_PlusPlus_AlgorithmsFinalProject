# C++ Algorithms Final Project: Casino Roulette & Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to my C++ algorithms final project repository, showcasing a dynamic casino roulette game with an exciting twist: an integrated Tic-Tac-Toe mini-game.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a practical application of data structures and algorithms in C++. It combines the thrill of a casino roulette game with the fun of playing Tic-Tac-Toe, making it an engaging and educational experience. Disclamer the project is a work in progress and not everything works to its best extent.

## Features

- **Casino Roulette Game:**
